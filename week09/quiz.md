# Choose two
+ Create a sketch with four LEDs. When you reset the Arduino, two of the four lights should turn on, and it should be truly random (or at least as random as we discussed). <EC: Print out the pin #s of the LEDs that are on.>

+ Create a sketch with a potentiometer and a speaker. The speaker should "beep" (not pop) and the potentiometer should control the amount of time between beeps. Use the function we discussed in class to make the range of time between beeps to be 50ms and 500ms.

+ Create a sketch with an LED. The LED should blink every half second. Create a variable that keeps track of how many times the LED has blinked and print it out of the Serial Monitor. It should like: 
```
The LED has blinked 1 times
The LED has blinked 2 times
```
+ Create a a sketch with four LEDs and a potentiometer. The pot controls how many LEDs are on, such that when the pot is turned all the way to one side none of the LEDs are on, and as you rotate the pot the LEDs start to turn on in order until they are all on.
