# Week 14

## Serial as String examples

## Final Project Proposals

+ Listen to all the ideas, discuss feasibility, etc:
	+ What is the concept?
	+ How can it be technically achieved?
	+ What materials are necessary?
	+ What do you need to learn in order to pull it off?

+ Develop a plan for the remainder of the semester
	+ Weekly check-ins with progress reports
		+ Reading/Response grades will be largely based on this
		+ Every week, give an update on your project. What have you achieved? And What is left to do? Take photos at every stage as well
		+ Place these inside a folder called "progress_reports" in your repo

+ Final projects are due Tuesday December 12th, this is the last day we will meet as a class for the semester (no finals week exam)
