## Sol Lewitt's Wall Drawings

Wall drawings that require iteration:

Wall Drawing 138: Circles and arcs from the midpoints of four sides.

## Concepts
+ Iteration

	+ It's worth noting that Dan Shiffman and some other programmers prefer the use of while() loops. Just now that they are essentially the same thing, but for() loops are much more common, so we will use them here

## Homework
+ Reproduce 3 Sol Lewitt line drawings in Processing
	+ At least 2 must use for loops!
	+ [Here](http://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) is an archive of Sol Lewitt Wall Drawings, but feel free to find more on your own.
