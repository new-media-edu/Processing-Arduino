# Quiz 1

Each quiz question should be saved as an individual Processing sketch and pushed to your git repository by the end of class. The uploads are time stamped, and no late work will be accepted. Make a folder titled "quiz1" and save each answer like "question1", "question2", and so on...

1. Create a sketch that is 500x500 pixels. Make the left half of the window black and the right half yellow. Additionally, print a random whole number to the console. This process should not loop.

2. Recreate the following Sol Lewitt Line Drawing in a Processing sketch

Wall Drawing 154: A black outlined square with a red horizontal line from the midpoint of the left side toward the middle of the right side.

3. Create a sketch that draws lines that go from the corners of the window to the mouse position. You should be able to move the mouse and have the lines follow. 

4. Create a sketch that draws a circle with a random color to a random position in the window every time the x key is pressed on the keyboard. Previously drawn circles should remain visible. Make it so that when the b key is pressed, the sketch is erased to a random background color.

5. (Extra Credit) Create a sketch with a circle at the center. The circle starts at 1 pixel in diameter and grows until it reaches the edges of the sketch window. The circle then shrinks until it is 1 pixel in diameter and the process repeats itself.
